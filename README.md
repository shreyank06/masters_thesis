csv files for amf are stored in Python_Code/amf_csv_files folder. Files are generated after restarting ph_init and executing registration commands with combination given in the names of the csv file names. Some files could already have some registrations before executing the given combination because small initial registrations are performed to see if the data is being reflected on Prometheus or Grafna UI and then proceeding with the commands.
