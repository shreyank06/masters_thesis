#Scalecast

# This package is for forecasters who know their models will need to be validated and used to produce forecasts 
# on a future horizon. Maybe you donâ€™t want to spend as much 
# time breaking down the fine details of the model. If that is the case, 
# the basic flow of the code, from importing results, to testing and forecasting, goes like this:
